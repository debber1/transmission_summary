	\section{The Smith diagram for lossless lines with applications}
		\subsection{What is a smith chart?}
			The Smith diagram (SD) is a graphical tool that allows to \textbf{solve most (lossless) transmission line problems}. The SD is nothing but the complex $\Gamma$-plane in which the corresponding values of $Z_x$ are also indicated. 
			
		\subsection{Construction and properties of the Smith diagram}
			\subsubsection{Property 1}
				As discussed in section \ref{sec:refl_coeff_complex_plane}, $|\Gamma|\leq1$. This means that \textbf{the SD is bounded by the unit circle where the origin corresponds to a matched line}. A few other notable values on the SD are:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item $Z_L=0$: a shorted line
					\item $Z_L=\infty$: an open line
					\item $Z_L=jX$: purely reactive load (does not consume power)
				\end{itemize}
