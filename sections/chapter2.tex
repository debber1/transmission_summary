	\section{The lossless transmission line}
		\subsection{Parameters of the lossless line}
			For a \textbf{lossless transmission line}, we say $R' = G' = 0$ in figure \ref{fig:trans_line_lumped_model}. This leads to the following simplifications:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The \textbf{complex propagation constant} becomes $\gamma = j\omega\sqrt{L'C'}$, meaning that $\alpha$ (the attenuation constant) is 0 and $\beta$ (the phase constant) is $\omega\sqrt{L'C'}$.
				\item The \textbf{characteristic impedance} becomes $Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{L'}{C'}}=R_0$, a real-valued parameter.
			\end{itemize}
